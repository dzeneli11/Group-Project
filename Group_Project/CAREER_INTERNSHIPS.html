<h1><b><u>Internships</u></b></h1>

			<h3>Looking for Success? Find it With an Internship!</h3>

			<p>As you continue to work toward earning your degree and setting goals for the future, gaining practical work experience through an internship will provide you with a multitude of advantages when entering the professional world.
				Most employers prefer to hire students who have had previous internship experience or those students who interned directly for them.
				Acquiring an internship while you are an undergraduate student is an ever-increasing component to the educational experience.
				Internships provide you with varied work experiences and offer a wide range of professional opportunities.
				By being a proactive student who actively seeks out internships you will not only gain knowledge, but also vital work experience.
			</p>

<p><u> What are the benefits of an internship?</u></p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square" class="b">

			<h3>Where can I intern</h3>
			<p>
			The Career Center recommends that students begin planning for the internship process early in their academic careers as first-years and sophomores.
			Internships generally are offered year-round. Students should have a suggested minimum of one internship during their college career,
			but more if possible.
		</p>

			<h3>What types of internships are available?</h3>
			<p>
			The Career Center posts many different types of internships in a wide variety of fields for students.
			Internships may be paid, unpaid or for credit. Internships vary according to industry and organization.
			For Credit Internships – Many internships may meet eligibility requirements for you to earn academic credit through either your major department,
			the Off-Campus Education Office, or the Study Abroad Office.
			Internship descriptions must be supplied to one of these offices to qualify for credit.
			Please check with your major department for internship guidelines and requirements:
			<p>
			<p><u> These are the schools that are relevant to your major</u></p>
			<li>Hofstra College of Liberal Arts & Sciences</li>
			<li>Frank G. Zarb School of Business</li>
			<li>Fred DeMatteis School of Engineering and Applied Science</li>
			<li>Lawrence Herbert School of Communication</li>
			<li>School of Education</li>
			<li>School of Health Professions and Human Services</li>
			</b></font></h2>

			<p>
			<u>Non-Credit Internships</u> – Some internships do not require academic credit, or a student may not wish to earn academic credit.
			When participating in a non-credit internship, students may then be compensated with a salary, stipend, or travel reimbursement.
			Or, an internship may be unpaid but offers a wide variety of career opportunities and a beneficial learning experience.
